# php-registration
Registration page with HTML, Css and PHP.
For any developer who would like to speed up their project.
The html css and php are set and ready to be use by user to send information to PHP_SELF.
You can use a SQL code to send the user informations to any Database of your choices.
Another repository of mine will have the same registration page with SQL code added.
You can also find the same registration page with only html and Css so you can add your own back-end code and server side language.
